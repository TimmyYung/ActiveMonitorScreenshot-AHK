# ActiveMonitorScreenshot-AHK

Capture Screenshots of the Active Monitor with a Single Keystroke!

## Introduction

ActiveMonitorScreenshot-AHK is an AutoHotkey script that simplifies the process of taking screenshots by allowing you to capture the content of your active monitor with the press of the Print Screen key. No more cumbersome multi-monitor captures or the need for complex screenshot software.

2. **Customize the Script:** Open the script file (`ScreenshotOneMonitor.ahk`) in a text editor and customize it to your preferences. 

3. **Run the Script:** Simply run the script (usually by double-clicking it) to activate the screenshot functionality.

4. **Capture Screenshots:** Press your configured hotkey (by default, it's set to `Print Screen`) to capture screenshots of the active monitor.

## Run on Startup
